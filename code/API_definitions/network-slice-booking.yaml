  title: Network Slice Booking
  description: |
    The Network Slice Booking (NSB) API provides programmable interface for developers to reserve a slice resource of a selected area within a period, and manage device access control as needed.
    For specific details, please refer to [Network Slice Booking API Design.md](/documentation/API_documentation/Network_Slice_Booking_API_Design.md).

    # Introduction

    This API allows the API consumer to book the availability of a session (also known as a "network slice"), specifying the service time, service area, and quality of service (QoS) profile.
    It checks whether the requested QoS profile can be guaranteed for the indicated time and area, and, if so, it reserves the network slice accordingly, and monitors that the slice delivers the QoS profile. The latter process is known as Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring.

    The API consumer can also retrieve information about an existing session or delete a session.

    # API functionality

    The API provides the following functionality:
    - Create a new session (network slice), specifying the service time, service area, and QoS profile.
    - Retrieve information about an existing session, including the service time, service area, and QoS profile.
    - Delete an existing session.

    # Request Parameters Definition:
    * **serviceTime**: is defined by a start time and an end time, which indicates the period during which the network slice will be reserved.
    * **serviceArea**: can be defined as a circle or a polygon, allowing for flexible geographical coverage.
    * **sliceQosProfile**: includes parameters such as maximum number of devices, downstream and upstream rate per device, and packet delay budget.
    * **sessionId**: is a unique identifier for the session, which is returned when a session is created and used to retrieve or delete the session later.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

        NOTES:
        - If expected network slice resources are not available, the API consumer will receive an error response with code `422 - NETWORK_SLICE_BOOKING.RESOURCES_NOT_APPLICABLE`.
        - If session creation is successful, the API consumer will receive a response with code `201 - Created` and a session ID.

        NOTES:
        - The deletion operation takes effect immediately, e.g. if the session is deleted before the end of the service time, the service will end ahead of the scheduled time.
        - If the session is deleted, the API consumer will not be able to retrieve information about the session.
        - The deletion operation is idempotent, meaning that if the session is already deleted, the API consumer will receive a response with code `204 - No Content`.
