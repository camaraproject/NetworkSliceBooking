  title: Network Slice Assignment
  description: |
    This API enables the assignment and release of the device to an existing network slice, as well as retrieving information about devices assigned to a slice or slices assigned to a device.

    This API works with the Network Slice Booking API, which is responsible for creating and managing network slices. The Network Slice Assignment API allows API consumers to manage user subscription to the network slices.

    # Functionality
    The Network Slice Assignment API provides the following functionalities:
    - **Assign Device**: Allows the API consumer to assign a device to an existing network slice, ensuring that the number of devices does not exceed the maximum defined in the slice QoS profile.
    - **Release Device**: Enables the API consumer to release a device from an existing network slice.
    - **Get Assigned Devices**: Retrieves information about devices currently assigned to a specific network slice.
    - **Retrieve Slices by Device**: Retrieves the list of network slices to which a specific device is assigned.

    # Terms and Definitions

    * **Notification Sink and Token**:
    API consumers can provide a notification sink URL and an optional sink credential when assigning a device to a slice. The notification sink is the URL where the API response will be asynchronously delivered, using the HTTP protocol. The sink credential provides authentication or authorization information necessary to enable delivery of events to the target.

    # Parameters

    * **sliceQosProfile**: A set of quality of service parameters that define the requirements for the network slice. It includes parameters such as maximum number of devices, downlink and uplink throughput per device, and latency requirements.
    * **sliceId**: A unique identifier for a network slice, obtained from the createSlice operation of the Network Slice Booking API.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

      summary: Assign a device to a network slice
      description: |
        Assign a device to an existing network slice. The number of devices assigned to the slice must not exceed the maximum number defined in the slice QoS profile.
        - If the assignment operation is successful, the response will indicate the status as `SUCCESS`.
        - If the number of devices exceeds the maximum allowed for the slice, the response will indicate the status as `FAILURE` with statusInfo as `MAX_DEVICES_EXCEEDED`.
        - If the device is already assigned to the slice, the response will indicate the status as `FAILURE` with statusInfo as `DEVICE_ALREADY_ASSIGNED`.
        - If the assignment operation is still in progress, the response will indicate the status as `PENDING`.

        **NOTES:**
        - The access token may be either 2-legged or 3-legged. See "Identifying the device from the access token" for further information
          - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

In this case, the API Provider will use one of the identifiers for the API logic without performing any matching checks among the provided identifiers.
            NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

This parameter is only returned when the API consumer includes the `device` parameter in their request (i.e. they are using a two-legged access token), and is relevant when more than one device identifier is specified, as only one of those device identifiers is allowed in the response.

        If the API consumer provides more than one device identifier in their request, and this schema is included in the response definition, the API provider MUST use it to return a single identifier which is the one they are using to fulfil the request, even if the identifiers do not match the same device. API provider does not perform any logic to validate/correlate that the indicated device identifiers match the same device. No error should be returned if the identifiers are otherwise valid to prevent API consumers correlating different identifiers with a given end user.

    DeviceIpv4Address:

      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
